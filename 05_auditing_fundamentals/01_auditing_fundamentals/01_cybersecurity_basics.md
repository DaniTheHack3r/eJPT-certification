4. Where do we begin?

We need to understand and promote the CIA Triad. It means Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability. It moves and fluctuates with the needs of the business. But at all times it remains a triangle.

  - Confidentiality: For Your Eyes Only.
  - Integrity: Only Authorized Changes, Please.
  - Availability: I have a job to do here.

There's a balance between these three points in order to meet business needs.

The size of the company, the type of business they run, what type of information they handle and what they need to secure is very important to understand what security measures need to be put in place and it will shape the actions needed from a cyber security perspective.

7. Risk Management

We have to understand this is a business and money plays a big factor. How mucho does it cost to secure something vs what the cost is going to be if we poorly secure it?

It could come down to insurance, possible lawsuits in the case of a breach, loss of revenue if intellectual property is lost.
