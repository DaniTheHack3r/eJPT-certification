This lab is the first part of the lab 1 of vulnerability assessment course.

**Note**: Performing a host discovery scan is prime when just opening the scanner.

**Note**: Just after performing a host discovery scan, we can proceed with a basic network scan. It will scan ports using syn scanner and will scan for vulnerabilities in the system. As the name implies, a basic network scan won't check for more specific vulnerabilities.

**Note**: The idea of this kind of auditing is to match the results with what we have set and report the findings if we see that something must be checked out.

**Note**: With this sort of tools we can generate different types of reports like pdf, html and csv.

**Note**: After performing a basic scan, we can now perform an advanced scan with the current information about the host so we can be more specific about what we want to get from the target.

**Note**: Taking into consideration different sources of vulnerabilities like third party tools or libraries used in our systems, or bad code reviewing is important in order to recommend what to do in the reports so different teams can take a look and decide what to do.

**Note**: The CSV format can be used to have a more broad view of different machines down the line when we perform different scans in the network.

**Note**: In the end, including recommendations based on the vulnerability scanner result must go along understanding what their maturity is and recommend actions based on that so you can definetely add value to your customer and is very important as a pentester.
