# SCAP scann and Stigviewer

the Security Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) are guides and tools for Standarization Across Organizations. These guides actually map back to NIST SP 800-53B. And The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) is how we scan for those requirements.

**Note**: This should be a lab but it is not available at the moment.

Stigviewer presents results divided into three categories:

- CAT I: It describes how failure to comply can lead to exploitation of which will directly and inmediately result in loss of CIA.
- CAT II: It describes how potential loss of CIA could occur.
- CAT III: degrades measures to protect against loss of CIA.

**Note**: In the end, the scan and findings are just results that you can use to build your report. You still need to consider the business needs and the cyber maturity of the organization.
