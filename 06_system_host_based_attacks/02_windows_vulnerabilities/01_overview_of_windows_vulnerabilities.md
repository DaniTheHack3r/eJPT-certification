# Overview of Windows Vulnerabilities

1. A brief History of Windows Vulnerabilities

  - Microsoft Windows is the dominant operating system worldwide with a market share >=70% as of 2021.
  - The popularity and deployment of Windows by individuals and companies makes it a prime target for attackers given the threat surface.
  - Over the last 15 years, Windows has had its fair share of severe vulnerabilities, ranging from MS08-067 (Coinflicker) to MS17-010 (EternalBlue).
  - Given the popularity of Windows, most of these vulnerabilities have publicly accessible exploit code making them relatively straightforward to exploit.

2. Windows vulnerabilities

  - Microsoft Windows has various OS versions and releases which makes the threat surface fragmented in terms of vulnerabilities. For example, vulnerabilities that exist in Windows 7 are not present in Windows 10.
  - Regardless of the various versions and release, all Windows OS's share a likeness given the development model and philosophy:
    + Windows OS's have been developed in the C programming language, making them vulnerable to buffer overflows, arbitrary code execution, etc.
    + By default, Windows is not configured to run securely and require a proactive implementation of security practices in order to configure Windows to run securely.
    + Newly discovered vulnerabilities are not inmediately patched by Microsoft and given the fragmented nature of Windows, many systems are left unpatched.
  - The frequent releases of new versions of Windows is also a contributing factor to exploitation, as many companies take a substantial length of time to upgrade their system to the latest version of Windows and opt to use older versions that may be affected by an increasing number of vulnerabilities.
  - In addition to inherent vulnerabilities, Windows is also vulnerable to cross platform vulnerabilities, for example, SQL injection attacks.
  - System/hosts running Windows are also vulnerable to physical attacks like; theft, malicious perpheral devices, etc.

3. Types of Windows Vulnerabilities

  - Information disclosure - Vulnerability that allows an attack to access confidential data.
  - Buffer overflows - Caused by a programming error, allows attackers to write data to a buffer and overrun the allocated buffer, consequently writing data to allocated memory addresses.
  - Remote code execution - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to remotely execute code on the target system.
  - Privilege escalation - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to elevate their privileges after initial compromise.
  - Denial of Service (DOS) - Vulnerability that allows an attacker to consume a system/host's resources (CPU, RAM, Netowrk, etc) consequently preventing the system from functioning normally.
