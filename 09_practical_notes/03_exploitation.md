# Exploitation Notes

- I found this reverse shell article pretty useful https://ironhackers.es/herramientas/reverse-shell-cheat-sheet/ as it contains pearl, php, bash and python reverse shell scripts.

- When sending payloads through the internet, it is better option to encode it, so it is difficult to spot and easier to transport.

- Exploiting a vulnerability related to sessions on a website can be rather easy, as sometimes people leave the user ids as plain numbers. So we can try to exploita that vulnerability using burp suite.

- To exploit a system, we need to consider all the technologies the system is using. For example, if the system is using php, we can try to upload php web shells to the server as it is capable of serving php web pages. This applies to any type of technology.

- When uploading files to a web server, they are always exposed statically, try using dir buster to figure out where they're being held.

- Remember that when trying to exploit SUID, the binary or script that has SUID enabled, can be written on an insecure manner. For example, it could be trying to call `cat` instead of `/bin/cat`, which opens the opportunity to change the path to another one and create a fake cat file.

- Once you have access to the machine through a shell in linux, the next step is to upgrade the terminal to a fully interactive tty. For this we can run the following commands:
    + From remote shell: `python -c "import pty;pty.spawn('/bin/bash')"`
    + From remote shell: `export TERM=xterm` xterm is the default option and it works very well in any ocassion in linux.
    + Open a second terminal in your computer of the same size and run `stty -a`. Copy the values rows and columns and save it.
    + From remote shell: set rows and cols `stty rows $ROWS cols $COLS`.
    + Now from the remote shell press ctrl+z and execute `stty raw -echo`. And `fg` to return to the previous process. Restart the shell with `restart` or press enter.
