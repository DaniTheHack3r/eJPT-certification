# Servers and Services

Before we start with service and server enumeration, we need to understand a couple of things about them.

## What are they?

- A server provides some sort of functionality to users and that can be used from other devices. Technically, any computer can be a server depending on how you set it up.
- On the other hand, services are applications that open a port in the server which users can connect to and use the functionality that the service handles.

## Why are they important? What do they mean to cyber security?

- They are important because they can be used and accessed from many users connected to the network, and pooling functionalities and information in one place is an juicy target for penetration testers and rogue adversaries.
