# Leaked Password Databases

The idea of using these leaked password databases is to find leaked passwords related to a certain email address or username and utilize those leaked password in other platforms, this technique is called password spray attack.

One of the most popular sites to find leaked emails or numbers is https://haveibeenpwned.com. The main use for a penetration tester is when finding email addresses using tools like theHarvesters, we can use have I been pwned to get some information from those email addresses as well.

**Note**: getting passwords is not illegal if they are publicly available, using those passwords and targeting real people could get you into serious problems with law.
