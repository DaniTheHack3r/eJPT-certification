# Website footprinting with netcraft

Netcraft (www.netcraft.com) is a website that contains a great amount of information about a site, such as whois information, operating systems, web technologies used by the website, etc.

This is paid service, however, it can be used from time to time for a single website runing a scan with https://sitereport.netcraft.com/?url=https://your.webiste.com.

We can get specifically web technologies and frameworks, ssl/tls certificate information, network information, ip delegation which are really important when doing penetration testing.
