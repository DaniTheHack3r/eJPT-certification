# Nessus lab

Nessus essentials is a vulnerability scanner that can we used to make assessments in hosts and websites in the network. These vulnerabilities can be then be presented to the client as report.

**Note**: Nessus essentials is a free tier that can be used by anyone, it is a pretty good tool and performs very well in short scope sites.

**Note**: It is usually pretty good to receive these kind of reports before hand during a pentest. If your client doesn't usually perform these kind of vulnerability assessments, it is a good idea to recommend that they do it regularly.

**Note**: If it is between the time limit and scope of the pentest, it is useful to perform prove of concepts of the vulnerabilities that you find, this gives even more information about what could happen and therefor about the criticallity of the bug found.

**Note**: Always give options when doing the report for a client or company, they are the ones that need to find a solution that fits them best, or they are the ones that understand and accept the risk.
