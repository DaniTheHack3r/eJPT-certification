# Vulnerabilities

1. What are vulnerabilities?

**Nist definition**: A weakness in the computation logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

**Note**: Imagine cybersecurity as a heist. There is something you have to extract from it and there is people trying to protect them. And there are vulnerabilities that externals could exploit.

The first layer, but not always needed, that comes to play when assessing for vulnerabilities is comformed by physical controls. In this case we can take a look at cameras, vaults, mantraps, proper door locks, gates, fences, lighting.

Now when talking about cybersecurity, there are two types of vulnerabilities, one comes from operating systems and other ones from the software installed on those operating systems.

2. Who Finds vulnerabilities?

  - DevSecOps engineers.
  - Security Researches.
  - Pentesters.
  - Software Developers.
  - Users, on accident?

**Note**: Often playing as a User could help you find some vulnerabilities.

3. Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure (CVE)

The CVE program, funded by the US department of homeland security and managed by MITRE, is a compilation of all well known vulnerabilities out there.

They have identifier, also called CVE names, CVE numbers, CVE-IDs or just CVEs. Example: CVE-2021-44228 (LOG4J), CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed), CVE-2017-0143 (Eternal Blue).

4. National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

Managed by NIST, it is a pretty useful tool that can be used along CVE.

Vunerability Detail Pages like CVE and NVD can present the following information:

- Description
- Severity
- References
- Weakness Enumeration
- Known Affected Software configurations

**Note**: Take a look at Common Platform Enumeration (CPE) in NVDs.

**Note**: Impact is what really matters to the clients, so it is important that we can explain why something is critical.

5. Zero Day Exploits, Zero-Data acts

Vulnerabilities in CVE and NVD are all documented and were submitted to the in order to be presented to the public. Zero Days are exploits that no one knows about or no one has reported to the CVE organization. When discovered by pentesters or cybersecurity researches it usually gives them some prestige.

6. Not All Vulnerabilities are computer code

Social skills are pretty useful for pentesters. They can try to break into a facility or convince some people remotely to get access to a network or host. They can try to sneak pass security using counterfeit badges or stolen credentials.

7. Business Needs

Raging from small businesses to giant corporations, they all could look at things differently. Banking and health systems usually have different regulations and compliance they need to meet. In any case, every one of them meet and decide where to spend their money on, even if it is not formal.

When presenting recommendations to the management, we need to get into risk management, we need to understand the impact and usefulness of our report to properly deliver some value into risk management.

Risk Management > Vulnerability Management > Vulnerability Assessment > Penetration Test.

8. How do we find these vulnerabilities?

- Scanning
- Asset Identification + Research
- Fuzz Testing (input/handling validation)
