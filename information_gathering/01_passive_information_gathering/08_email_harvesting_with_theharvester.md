# Email harvesting with theHarvester

TheHarvester is a utility similar to sublist3r but for emails. It will try to fetch leaked emails from publicly available sources. Its main use is for open source intelligence (OSINT) gathering to help determine a company's external threat landscape on the internet.

It comes prepackaged with kali linux and can be used with many different search engines across the internet.

This utility is used for passive information gathering.

Note: spyse is a very good search engine for penetration testers.
