# Recon and footprinting

## Passive recon

- IP Adresses
- Directories hidden from search engines
- Names
- Email adresses
- Phone Numbers
- Physical Addresses
- Web technologies being used

## Gathering dns info

- Host is a utility we could use for dns lookup
- When we get more than one ip address in a dns lookup, we are facing some form of proxy.

## Get personal information

- You could get names from social media and inside the website as well.
- Check for links that could take you to identify any names or personal information about anyone in the company.

## Find hidden directories

- Take a look at the robots.txt, it could have very important information about the routes of the site.
- Another important file is the sitemap, to get more information about publicly accesible pages.

## Profile information about the site using built with technology profilers

- Use technology profilers like builtwith to see what's running on the website.
- There are several options: Wappalyzer and Builtwith browser extensions and whatweb utility (terminal).
