# Pass-the-Hash With PsExec

+ Pass-the-hash is an exploitation technique that involves capturing or harvesting NTLM hashes or clear-text passwords and utilizing them to authenticate with the target legitimately.

+ We can use the PsExec module to legitimately authenticate with the target system via SMB.

+ This technique will allow us to obtain access to the target system via legitimate credentials as opposed to obtaining access via service exploitation.
