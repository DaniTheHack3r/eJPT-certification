# Dumping Hashes with Mimikatz

+ Mimikatz is a Windows post-exploitation tool written by Benjamin Delpy (@gentilkiwi). It allows for the extraction of plaintext credentials from memory, password hashes from local SAM databases, and more.

+ The SAM (Security Account Manager) database, is a database file on Windows systems that stores users passwords and can be used to authenticate users both locally and remotely.

+ We can utilize the pre-built mimikatz executable, alternatively, if we have access to a meterpreter session on a Windows target, we can utilize the inbuilt meterpreter extension Kiwi.

+ Kiwi allows us to dynamically execute Mimikatz on the target system without touching the disk.
