# Windows Recon: Zenmap

In this exercise we will be in a windows VM with zenmap installed. To start, we want to get some information about the network with `ipconfig`. After identifying the network, we will try to probe it.

Zenmap is the GUI version of nmap, so it is the same tool with the same capabilities. The main advatange is that the results are presented ordered by sections, so it gives you a little bit more of value that way.
